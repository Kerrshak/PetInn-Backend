# Pet Inn Backend

## Summary

This is a backend server that uses its endpoints to access, store, and alter data on MongoDB. It is designed to be used with a pet & home sitting app that can be found here: `https://github.com/YeastWrangler/Pet-Inn`

## Minimum node version

v18.4.0

## Setup

In shell navigate to the directory you want to clone the repo to. Then use  
`git clone https://github.com/Kerrshak/PetInn-Backend`

You will need to create a file called `.env` in the `PETINN-BACKEND` folder. A guide on how to set this up to work with mongoDB can be found here: `https://northflank.com/guides/connecting-to-a-mongo-db-database-using-node-js`

Open the repo in your chosen code editor. To install the necessary dependencies open the terminal and run  
`npm install`

Then, to locally host the server, run `npm run dev` in the terminal. It can then be accessed from `http://localhost:9090/`

## Hosted site

`https://busy-ruby-narwhal-kit.cyclic.app`
